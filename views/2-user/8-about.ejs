                        <h3>Background of the Station</h3>
                            <p>DLSU-D (Formerly DWSU) 95.9 Green FM, also known simply as Green FM or La Salle Radio, is the official campus radio station of De La Salle University – Dasmariñas.</p>
                            <p>Green FM is found on the frequency modulation (FM) band 95.9 MHz with a transmitter power of 10-20 watts and an estimated signal reach of a three-kilometer radius.</p>
                            <p>The station call letters DWSU was assigned by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) when the station started operating under the name La Salle Radio in </p>
                            <p>August 2005 under the initiative of the Communication Arts Department (CAD), now called Communication and Journalism Department (CJD) Chair Ms. Rosanni Recreo Sarile.</p>
                            <p>The station was directly supervised by the former CJD Professor Ms. Maria Aurora Quadra-Balibay from 2007 to 2019 with a team of student managers, staff, and apprentices.</p>
                            <p>The role was given to former CJD Chair Mr. Artin Umali in 2019. At present, Mr. Umali is still supervising Green FM as its station manager.</p>
                            <p><strong>In 2016,</strong> Green FM created the award-winning Animo Channel TV Project to provide a pay television platform for the made-for-television versions of the radio shows. Animo Channel TV</p>
                            <p>was made available for viewing in Cavite and Region 4-A pay television via the Cable Operators Association of Cavite (COAC) partners.</p>
                            <p><strong>In 2019,</strong> Green FM gave college student governments, interest organizations, administrative offices, members of the faculty, and support staff more airtime and block schedules to cater to the growing</p>
                            <p>needs of the community. This came to be what is now known as Green FM’s Blocktimer Program which saw the organization’s growth as it partnered with the integral members of the Lasallian community.</p>
                            <p><strong>In 2020,</strong> however, the global pandemic has affected Green FM’s broadcasting. Due to lockdown restrictions, Green FM members were barred from entering the station located inside the university.</p>
                            <p> As a result of working remotely, Green FM moved its shows from the airwaves to the internet. This paved the way for the DLSU-D Green FM Podcasts. From the usual packed 9-to-5 programming,</p>
                            <p>Green FM reduced the number of its shows to 5 which were posted on the organization’s official Facebook Page, Spotify, and Apple Podcasts.</p>
                            <p>As Green FM approaches the new academic year, it aims to “reboot” its presence on the airwaves as Green FM successfully transitioned to the new normal. </p>
                            <p>Green FM is seeking to revive the traditional programming and airing while incorporating the latest trends and developments from the digital era. </p>
                            <p>Aside from its original programming, it also plans to create more robust programs strengthened by its blocktimers from different organizations and communities within De La Salle University- Dasmariñas.</p>
